A recreation of early Excel-like programs.

Was a partner program, I created all code for Cell, FormulaCell, NumberCell, StringCell, and TextExcel. all code in Spreadsheet
excluding code related to the printSpreadsheet, printDivider, and makeTwelve methods is mine as well.

Is unable to handle a formula cell which references a formula cell which eventually references the original formula cell.
Is also unable to handle majority of error cases and will crash.

Still, very good when proper syntax is used, and is capable of sorting rectangular ranges of cells and formulas with many operators and values.

Finished on April 22nd 2022.
